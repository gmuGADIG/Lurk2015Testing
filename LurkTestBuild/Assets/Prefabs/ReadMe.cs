//How to make a prefab!

//1. Make an object with stuff attached to it!
//2. Give it a snappy (and by snappy, I mean good and descriptive) name!
//3. Drag it into the Prefabs folder! The text for the object should turn blue in hierarchy tab. If not, come to me (Ashley)!
//4. Whenever you make changes to this object, make sure you push the apply button at the top of the Object's inspector to save the changes made to the prefab.
