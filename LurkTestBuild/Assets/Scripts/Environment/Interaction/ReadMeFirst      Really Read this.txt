the interactable script is an abstract class that is extended by interaction and conversation

conversation does not rely on interaction to work

use the conversation prefab in the convo diplay field in the conversation script

use the interaction prefab in the display field in the interaction script

the script interact is depricated - do not use it

i will update this if there is more information that is need for proper use


v2 ---------------------------------------------------------


conversation now has a field of type talkspritedisplay

this is used to display the talk sprites

this is used so that the sprite sheet is only cut up once instead of for every conversation

conversation prefab was updated and talkspritedisplay is on the conversation prefab
